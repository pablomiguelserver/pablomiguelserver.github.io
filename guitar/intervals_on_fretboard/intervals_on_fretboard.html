    <h1>Recognize Interval on Fretboard</h1>
    



    <p>
      Now that you can identify intervals by ear, the next step is to learn their positions on the guitar fretboard. It’s important to note that you’ll first focus on the last four strings of the guitar (G, D, A, E), and later move on to the rest. These are the most common shapes used on the fretboard.

	<p>
		To practice, you can use the app below.
Here’s how it works: start with your index finger on any fret, then place another finger in the position indicated by the numbers to form the interval.

 I made this because it takes me effort to come up with random positions so let the computer do it for me. once you can do this in 1 second or less for any position.
