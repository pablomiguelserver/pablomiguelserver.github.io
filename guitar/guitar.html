        This page is meant to be practiced with two sets of 5 minutes (one in the morning and one in the night) or only five minutes a day(you will get there either way).If you do more, you won’t learn as much.
        You don’t need to know music theory at all — just the concept of an interval: the distance between two notes. everything else will be taught in this webpage. 
      </p>

      <h2>Recognize Sound of Intervals (6 months)</h2>


      <p>
        It is important to know which interval is being played, and whether it is ascending or descending. We will use mnemonics—a common way of learning them.<a href="./sound_of_intervals/sound_of_intervals.html"> There are 13 total intervals</a>. Use a <a href="./mnemonic_table/mnemonic_table.html"> ✅ mnemonic table</a> to memorize them. 
      </p>

      <h2>Recognize Interval on Fretboard (2 weeks)</h2>
<p>
  In this stage, you’ll focus on not just hearing intervals but also locating
  <a href="./intervals_on_fretboard/intervals_on_fretboard.html">✅ their position on the guitar fretboard</a>.
  Every interval has a unique shape or pattern on the fretboard

      <h2>Recognizing Interval Sound and Position (1 year)</h2>

      <p>We need to understand a loop. First you need to recognize the interval by ear, find it in the fretboard and then play the interval.
        For every loop, you start again where you left off. </p>
      <p>Progress checklist:</p>
      <p>Can sing and play:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ One interval	 (2 weeks)</li>
        <li>✅ Two intervals  (2 weeks)</li>		
        <li>✅ Three intervals  (2 weeks)</li>
        <li>✅ More than three intervals (2 weeks)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Can hear and play (use this dictation app):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Two intervals (2 weeks)</li>
        <li>✅ Three intervals (2 weeks)</li>
        <li>✅ More than three intervals (2 weeks)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Can sing over chord progressions:(use the app chordchord)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ One interval (2 weeks)</li>
        <li>✅ Two intervals (2 weeks)</li>
        <li>✅ Three intervals (2 weeks)</li>
        <li>✅ More than three intervals (2 weeks)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Practice at 70 BPM. Faster BPM is harder.</p>
      <p>here first you sing anything you think sounds cool to you (the complete thing.donot use the loop), after finishing singing all, use the loop to play it   </p>
      <p>Thinking then playing (gain precision):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Make words (2 weeks)</li>
        <li>✅ Think at least three notes then play them (2 weeks)</li>
        <li>✅ Make phrases (2 weeks)</li>
        <li>✅ Join notes into meaningful phrases (2 weeks)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thinking and playing immediately (exchange precision for speed):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Play in real time (≤1s per note)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Learning the First Two Strings of the Guitar</h2>
      <p>We have to learn the <a href="./last_two_strings/last_two_strings.html"> ✅new shapes for these two strings</a>. You will see the same intervals, but with different shapes.</p>
