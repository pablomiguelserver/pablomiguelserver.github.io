        This page is meant to be practiced 5 minutes a day. If you do more, you won’t learn as much.
        You don’t need to know music theory at all — just the concept of an interval: the distance between two notes.

      <h2>Recognize Sound of Intervals (6 months)</h2>


      <p>
        <a href="./sound_of_intervals/sound_of_intervals.html"> There are 12 total intervals</a>. Use mnemonic devices to memorize them. For example, the interval of a major second appears in the "…ppy birth…" part of "Happy Birthday". Focus on the lyrics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I memorized intervals by listening to just the song fragment with the interval using <a href="https://audiomass.co/" target="_blank">audio mass app</a>.
        It took me two weeks per interval with just 5 minutes a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        While learning, test yourself with the  intervals you know on the  <a href="https://tonedear.com/ear-training/intervals" target="_blank">Toned Ear</a>  website 
. When you consistently score 90% accuracy, move to the fretboard section.

      <h2>Recognize Interval on Fretboard (2 weeks)</h2>
      <p>
        Now that you can identify the intervals with your ear, it's time to learn their position on the guitar fretboard. Start with the last 4 strings (G, D, A, E). These are the most common shapes used.
