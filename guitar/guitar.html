        This page is meant to be practiced 5 minutes a day. If you do more, you won’t learn as much.
        You don’t need to know music theory at all — just the concept of an interval: the distance between two notes.

      <h2>Recognize Sound of Intervals (6 months)</h2>


      <p>
        It is important to know which interval is being played, and whether it is ascending or descending. We will use mnemonics—a common way of learning them.<a href="./sound_of_intervals/sound_of_intervals.html"> There are 13 total intervals</a>. Use a <a href="./mnemonic_table/mnemonic_table.html"> ✅ mnemonic table</a> to memorize them. 
      </p>

      <h2>Recognize Interval on Fretboard (2 weeks)</h2>
<p>
  In this stage, you’ll focus on not just hearing intervals but also locating
  <a href="./intervals_on_fretboard/intervals_on_fretboard.html">✅ their position on the guitar fretboard</a>.
  Every interval has a unique shape or pattern on the fretboard

      <h2>Recognizing Interval Sound and Position (1 year)</h2>

      <p>We need to understand "the loop". you need to recognize the interval, find it in the fretboard and then play the interval.
        For every loop, you start again where you left off. </p>
      <p>Progress checklist:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Sing one interval	</li>
        <li>✅ Sing two intervals in a row</li>		
        <li>✅ Sing three intervals in a row</li>
        <li>✅ More than three intervals</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Can hear and play (use this dictation app):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Two intervals</li>
        <li>✅ Three intervals</li>
        <li>✅ More than three intervals</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Can sing over chord progressions:(use the app chordchord)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ One interval</li>
        <li>✅ Two intervals</li>
        <li>✅ Three intervals</li>
        <li>✅ More than three intervals</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Practice at 70 BPM. Faster BPM is harder.</p>
      <p>here first you sing anything you think sounds cool to you (the complete thing.donot use the loop yet), after finishing singing all, use the loop to play it   </p>
      <p>Thinking then playing (gain precision):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Make words</li>
        <li>✅ Think at least three notes then play them</li>
        <li>✅ Make phrases</li>
        <li>✅ Join notes into meaningful phrases</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thinking and playing immediately (exchange precision for speed):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Play in real time (≤1s per note)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Learning the First Two Strings of the Guitar</h2>
      <p>We have to learn the <a href="./last_two_strings/last_two_strings.html"> ✅new shapes for these two strings</a>. You will see the same intervals, but with different shapes.</p>
